A Senate is to withstand the occasional impetuosities of the 
more numerous branch. The members ought therefore to 
derive a firmness from the tenure of their places. It ought to 
supply the defect of knowledge and experience incident to the 
other branch, there ought to be time given therefore for attaining
the qualifications necessary for that ptirpose. It ought 
finally to maintain that system and steadiness in public affairs 
without which no Government can prosper or be respect able. 
This cannot be done by a body undergoing a frequent change 
of its members. A Senate for six years will not be dangerous 
to liberty, on the contrary it will be one of its best guardians. 
By correcting the mfirmities of popular Government, it will 
prevent that disgust ag** that form which may otherwise pro- 
duce a sudden transition to some very different one. It is no 
secret to any attentive & dispassionate observer of y* pel: 
situation of y* U, S., that the real danger to republican liberty 
has lurked in that cause*

The appointment of Senators by districts seems to be objec- 
tionable. A spirit of locality is inseparable from that mode. 
The evil is fully displayed in the County representations, the 
members of which are ever>Tvrhere observed to lose sight of the 
'aggregate interests of the Community » and even to sacrifice 
them to the interests or prejudices of their respective con- 
stituents. In general these local interests are n[uscalculated> 
But it is not impossible for a measure to be accommodated 
to the particular interests of every County or district » when 
considered by itself, and not so, when considered in relation 
to each other and to the whole State ; in the same manner as 
the interests of individuals may be very different in a state of 
nature and in a Political union. The most effectual remedy 
for the local bias is to impress on the minds of the Senators an 
attention to the interest of the whole Society, by making them 
the choice of the whole Society, each citizen voting for every 
Senator. The objection here is that the fittest characters 
would not be sufficiently known to the people at large. But 
in free governments » merit and notoriety of character are 
rarely separated, and such a regulation would connect them 
more and more together. Should this mode of election be on 
the whole not approved, that established in Maryland presents 
a valuable alternative. The latter affords perhaps a greater 
security for the selection of merit. The inconveniences
chargeable on it are two: first that the Council of electors 
favors cabal. Against this the shortness of its existence is a 
good antidote, secondly that in a large State the meeting of 
the Electors must be expensive if they be paid, or badly 
attended if the service is onerous. To this it may be answered 
that in a case of such vast importance, the expence, which 
could not be great, ought to be disregarded. Whichever of 
these modes may be preferred, it cannot be amiss so far to 
admit the plan of districts as to restrain the choice to persons 
residing in different parts of the State. Such a regulation 
will produce a diffusive confidence in the Body,- which is not 
less necessary than the other means of rendering it useful. 
In a State having large towns which can easily unite their 
votes the precaution would be essential to an immediate choice 
by the people at large. In Maryland no regard is paid to 
residence. And what is remarkable vacancies are filled by 
the Senate itself. This last is an obnoxious expedient and 
cannot in any point of view have much effect. It was proba- 
bly meant to obviate the trouble of occasional meetings of 
the Electors. But the purpose might have been otherwise 
answered by allowing the unsuccessful candidates to supply 
vacancies according to the order of their standing on the list 
of votes, or by requiring provisional appointments to be made 
along with the positive ones. If an election by districts be 
unavoidable and the ideas here suggested be sound, the evil 
will be diminished in proportion to the extent given to the 
districts, taking two or more Senators from each district. 

The first question arising here is how 
far property ought to be made a quali- 
fication. There is a middle way to be taken which corresponds 
at once with the Theory of free Government and the lessons of 
experience. A freehold or equivalent of a certain value may 
be annexed to y* right of voting for Senators, & y* right left 
more at large in y* election of the other House. Examples of 
this distinction may be found in the Constitutions of several 
States particularly if I mistake not, of North Carolina & N. 
ork. This middle mode reconciles and secures the two 
cardinal objects of Government ; the rights of persons, and the 
rights of property. The former will be sufficiently guarded by 
one branchy the latter more particularly by the other. Give 
all power to property, and y^ indigent will be oppressed. Give 
it to the latter and the effect may be transposed. Give a 
defensive share to each and each will be secure. The neces- 
sity of thus guarding the rights of property was for obvious 
reasons unattended to in the commencement of the Revolu- 
tion* In all the Governments which were considered as 
beacons to republican Patriots & lawgivers the rights of per- 
sons were subjected to those of property. The poor were 
sacrificed to the rich. In the existing state of American popu- 
lattoit Sc American property the two classes of rights were so 
little discriminated that a provision for the rights of persons 
was supposed to include of itself those of property, and it was 
natural to infer from the tendency of republican laws, that 
these different interests would be more and more identified. 
Experience and investigation have however produced more 
correct ideas on this subject. It is now observed that in all 
populous countries, the smaller part only can be interested in 
preserving the rights of property. It must be foreseen that 
America, and Kentucky itself will by degrees arrive at this 
stage of Society that in some parts of y Union a very great 
advance is already made towards it. It is well understood 
that interest leads to injustice as well where the opportunity 
is presented to bodies of men as to individuals ; to an interested 
majority in a Republic, as to the interested minority in any 
other form of Government. The time to guard ag*^ this danger 
is at the first forming of the Constitution, and in the present 
state of population when the bulk of the people have a 
sufficient interest in possession or in prospect to be attached 
to the rights of property, without being insufficiently at- 
tached to the rights of persons. Liberty not less than justice 
pleads for the policy here recommended. If all power be 
suffered to slide into hands not interested in the rights of 
property which must be the case whenever a majority fall 
under that description, one of two things cannot fail to hap- 
pen; either they will unite against the other description and 
become the dupes & instruments of ambition, or their poverty 
& dependence will render them the mercenary instruments of 
wealth. In either case liberty will be subverted: in the first 
by a despotism growing out of anarchy, in the second, by an 
oligarchy founded on corruption.

The second question under this head is whether the ballot 
be not a better mode than that of voting viva voce. The com- 
parative experience of the States pursuing the different modes 
is in favor of the first. It is found less difficult to guard 
against fraud in that than against bribery in the other.

Does not The exclusion of Ministers 
of the Gospel as such violate a funda- 
mental principle of liberty by punishing a religious profession 
with the privation of a civil right ? does it [not] violate another 
article of the plan itself which exempts religion from the 
cognizance of Civil power? does it not violate justice by at 
once taking away a right and prohibiting a compensation for 
it ? does it not in fine violate impartiality by shutting the door 
ag* the Ministers of one Religion and leaving it open for those 
of every other. 

The re-eligibility of members after accepting offices of profit 
is so much opposed to the present way of thinking in America 
that any discussion of the subject wotdd probably be a waste 
of time.

It is at least questionable whether 

death ought to be confined to "Treason 
and murder." It would not therefore be prudent to tie the 
hands of Government in the manner here proposed. The pro- 
hibition of pardon, however specious in theory wotdd have 
practical consequences which render it inadmissible. A single 
instance is a stiffident proof. The crime of treason is generally 
shared by a number, and often a very great number. It would 
be politically if not morally wrong to take away the lives of all
even if every iudividiial were equally guilty. What name 
would be given to a severity which made no distinction be- 
tween the legal & the moral offence — between the deluded 
multitude and their wicked leaders. A second trial would 
not avoid the difficulty; because the oaths of the jury would 
not permit them to hearken to any voice but the inexorable 
voice of the law. 

The power of the Legislature to appoint any other than 
their own officers departs too far from the Theory which 
requires a separation of the great Dep" of Govemmejit, One 
of the best securities against the creation of unnecessary 
offices or tyrannical powers is an exclusion of the authors 
from all share in filling the one, or influence in the execution 
of the other. The proper mode of appointing to offices wiH 
fall under another head. 

An election by the Legislature is 
liable to insuperable objections. It 
not only tends to faction intrigue and corruption, but leaves 
the Executive under the influence of an improper obhgation 
to that department. An election by the people at large, as 
in this * & several other States — or by Electors as in the ap- 
pointment of the Senate in Maryland, or, indeed » by the people 
through any other channel than their legislative representa- 
tives, seems to be far preferable. The ineligibility a second 
time, though not perhaps without advantages, is also liable 
to a variety of strong objections. It takes away one powerful 
motive to a faithful & useful administration, the desire of 
acquiring that title to a reappointment. By rendering a 
periodical change of men necessary, it discourages beneficial 
undertakings which require perseverance and system, or, as 
frequently happened in the Roman Consulate, either precipi- 
tates or prevents the execution of them. It may inspire 
desperate enterprises for the attainment of what is not attain- 
able by legitimate means. It fetters the judgment and in-
clination of the Community; and in critical moments woul 
either produce a violation of the Constitution or exclude 
choice [which] might be essential to the public safety. Ad 
to the whole, that by putting the Executive Magistrate in th 
situation of the tenant of an tmrenewable lease, it wotd< 
tempt him to neglect the constitutional rights of his depart 
ment, and to connive at usurpations by the Legislative de 
partment, with which he may connect his futtu% ambitioi 
or interest. 

The clause restraining the first magistrate from the immedi 
ate command of the military force would be made better b] 
excepting cases in which he should receive the sanction of th< 
two branches of the Legislature. 

The following variations are suggested. I. The election to be made by
the people immediately, or thro' some other meditun than the
Legislature. 2. A distributive choice shotdd perhaps be se 
cured as in the case of the Senate. 3. Instead of an ineligibilit] 
a second time, a rotation in the federal Senate, with ai 
abridgm^ of the term, to be substituted. 

The appointment to offices is, of all the ftmctions of Re 
publican & perhaps every other form of Government, th4 
most difficult to guard against abuse. Give it to a numerous 
body, and you at once destroy all responsibility, and create i 
perpetual source of faction and corruption. Give it to th< 
Executive wholly, and it may be made an engine of impropei 
influence and favoritism. Suppose the power were divide<i 
thus: let the Executive alone make all the subordinate ap- 
pointments, and the Gov* and Senate, as in the Fed^ Const* 
those of the superior order. It seems particularly fit that th< 
Judges, who are to form a distinct department should own 
their offices partly to each of the other departments, rathei 
than wholly to either.

Much detail ought to be avoided in the Constitutional regulation of this 
Department, that there may be room for changes which may
be demanded by the progressive changes in the state of our 
population. It is at least doubtful whether the number of 
Courts, the number of Judges, or even y* boundaries of Juris- 
diction ought to be made unalterable but by a revisal of the 
Constitution. The precaution seems no otherwise necessary 
than as it may prevent sudden modifications of the establish- 
ment, or addition of obsequious Judges, for y* purpose of 
evading the checks of the Const" & giv* effect to some sinister 
policy of the Legis'^, But might not the same object be other- 
wise attained? by prohibiting, for escample, any innovations 
in those particulars without the consent of that department: 
or without the annual sanction of two or three successive 
AssembUes, over & above the other pre-requisites to the 
passage of a law. 

The model here proposed for a Court of Appeals is not 
recommended by experience. It is found as might well be 
presumed that the members are always warped in their ap- 
pellate decisions by an attachment to the principles and 
jurisdiction of their respective Cotirts, & still more so by the 
previous decision on y* case removed by appeal. The only 
efficient cure for the evil is to form a Court of Appeals, of dis- 
tinct and select Judges. The expence ought not to be ad- 
mitted as an objection i. because the proper administration 
of Justice is of too essential a nature to be sacrificed to that 
consideration, 2. The number of inferior judges might in 
that case be lessened. 3. The whole department may be made 
to support itself by a judicious tax on law proceedings. 

The excuse for non-attendance would be a more proper 
subject of enquiry somewhere else than in the Court to which 
the party belonged. Delicacy, mutual convenience &c, would 
soon reduce the regulation to mere form; or if not, it might 
become a disagreeable source of little irritations among y* 
members. A certificate from the local Court or some other 
local authority where the party might reside or happen to be 
detained from his duty, expressing the cause of absence a$ 
well as that it was judged to be satisfactory, might be safely 
substituted. Few Judges would improperly claim their 
wages, if such a formality stood in the way. These observa* 
tions are applicable to the Cotmcil of State. 

A Court of Impeachments is among the most puzzling 
articles of a Republican Constitution ; and it is far more easy 
to point out defects in any plan than to supply a cure for them. 
The diversified expedients adopted in the Constitutions of the 
several States prove how much the compilers were embar- 
rassed on this subject. The plan here proposed varies from all 
of them, and is perhaps not less than any a proof of the difiS- 
culties which pressed the ingenuity of its author. The re- 
marks arising on it are i. That it seems not to square with 
reason that the right to impeach should be united to that of 
trying the impeachment, & consequently in a proportional 
degree, to that of sharing in the appointment of, or influence 
on the Tribtmal to which the trial may belong. 2. As the 
Executive & Judiciary would form a majority of the Court, 
and either have a right to impeach, too much might depend 
on a combination of these departments. This objection 
wotdd be still stronger if the members of the Assembly were 
capable as proposed of holding offices, and were amenable in 
that capacity to the Court. 3. The H. of Delegates and either 
of those departments could app' a majority of y^ Court. 
Here is another danger of combination, and the more to be 
apprehended as that branch of y* Legist w^ also have the 
right to impeach, a right in their hands of itself sufficiently 
weighty; and as the power of the Court w** extend to the 
head of the Ex, by whose independence the constit* rights of 
that department are to be secured ag*' Legislative usurpations. 
4. The dangers in the two last cases would be still more 
formidable, as the power extends not only to deprivation, 
but to future incapacity of office. In the case of all officers 
of sufficient importance to be objects of factious persecution, 
the latter branch of power is in every view of a delicate nature. 
In that of the Chief Magistrate it seems inadmissible, if he 
be chosen by the Legislature; and much more so, if im- 
mediately by the people themselves. A temporary incapaci- 
tation is y* most that c* be properly authorised. 

The 2 great desiderata in a Court of Impeach" are i. im- 
partiality. a, respectability — the first in order to a right, 
the second in order to a satisfactory decision. These charac- 
teristics are aimed at in the following modification Let the 
Senate be denied the right to impeach. Let | of the members 
be struck out, by alternate nominations of the prosecutors & 
party impeached; the remaining f to be the staftten of the 
Court. When the H. of Del: impeach let the Judges, or a 
certain proportion of them^ — and the Council of State be asso- 
ciated in the trial, when the Gov* or Cotincil impeaches, let 
the Judges only be associated; when the Judges impeach let 
the Council only be associated. But if the party impeached 
by the H. of Del* be a member of the Ex. or Judic"^. let that 
of which he is a member not be associated. If the party 
impeached belong to one & be impeached by the other of these 
branches, let neither of them be associated the decision being 
in this case left with the Senate alone; or if that be thought 
exceptionable, a few members might be added by y^ H. of D*. 
4 of the Court should in all cases be necessary to a conviction, 
& the Chief Magistrate at least should be exempt from a sen- 
tence of perpetual if not of temporary incapacity. It is ex- 
tremely probable that a critical discussion of this outline may 
discover objections which do not occur. Some do occur; but 
appear not to be greater than are incident to any different 
modification of the Tribunal. 

The establishment of trials by Jury 8c viva voce testimony 
in ail cases and in all Courts, is, to say the least, a delicate 
experiment; and would most probably be either violated, or 
be found inconvenient, 
A revisionary power is meant as a 
Council of Revision, u i i. * -j. j. * * * j ** 
check to precipitate, to unjust, and to 
unconstitutional laws. These important ends would it is 
conceded be more effectually secured, without disarming the 
Legislature of its requisite authority, by requiring bills to be 
separately communicated to the Exec: & Judic' dep'* If 
either of these object, let |, if both f of each House be neces- 
sary to overrule the objection; and if either or both protest 
ag^ a bill as violating the Constitution, let it moreover be 
suspended notwithstanding the overruling proportion of the 
Assembly, tmtil there shall have been a subsequent election 
of the H. of D* and a re-passage of the bill by | or f of both 
Houses, as the case may be. It s' not be allowed the Judges or 
yf Executive to pronounce a law thus enacted tmconstitu* & 
invalid. 

In the State Constitutions & indeed in the Fed* one also, 
no provision is made for the case of a disagreement in ex- 
poimding them; and as the Courts are generally the last in 
making y* decision, it results to them by refusing or not re- 
fusing to execute a law, to stamp it with its final character. 
This makes the Judiciary Dep^ paramount in fact to the Legis- 
lature, which was never intended and can never be proper. 

The extension of the Hab* Corp* to the cases in which it 
has been usually suspended, merits consideration at least. If 
there be emergencies which call for such a suspension, it can 
have no eflFect to prohibit it, because the prohibition will 
assuredly give way to the impulse of tht moment; or rather 
it will have the bad effect of facilitating other violations that 
may be less necessary. The Exemption of the press from 
liability in every case for true facts is also an innovation and 
as such ought to be well considered. This essential branch 
of liberty is perhaps in more danger of being interrupted by 
local tumults, or the silent awe of a predominant party, than 
by any direct attacks of Power.
