In their analyses, Mosteller and Wallace use writings by Madison and Hamilton
that were not a part of the Federalist Papers. These documents are not readily
available from Project Gutenberg, so I've saved them manually from the
Internet Archive.

Refer to the Appendix of Mosteller and Wallace for the bibliography for these
papers. They are also saved to Github because retrieving them is very, very
tedious.
